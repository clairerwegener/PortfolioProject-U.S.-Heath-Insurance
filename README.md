# PortfolioProject-U.S.-Heath-Insurance

This project is for the Data Science Career Track in Codecademy. The project goal was to take a data set and analyze it however we want using beginner python skills.

I reviewed whether the number of children had an impact on insurance charges (spoiler: doesn't look like it!) and practiced using graphing skills.
